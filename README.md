# computorV1
Projects of Ecolo 42(school 21) - solving polynomials of 2 degree
Usage ./computorv1.py <expression>
  
Expression example:
8 * X^0 - 6 * X^1 + 0 * X^2 - 5.6 * X^3 = 3 * X^0

Output example:
Equation: 1.0 + 4.0X = 0.0
Reduced form: 1.0 + 4.0X = 0.0
Polynomial degree: 1
a = 4.0
b = 1.0
The solution is:
-b / a = -0.25
